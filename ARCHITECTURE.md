# Employee Tracking System

## Domain
Employee Management within an organization.

## Problem Statement
Managing employee performance and tracking attendance manually is inefficient and prone to errors. The Employee Tracking System will automate these processes, allowing management to monitor employee activity in real-time, assign tasks, and generate performance reports.

## Individual Scope
The system will focus on tracking the following key components:
- Employee details (name, role, department, etc.)
- Attendance and working hours
- Task assignments and completion status
- Performance reports
- Dashboard to visualize key metrics

## C4 Architectural Diagrams
The following C4 diagrams will be included:
1. **Context Diagram** – Overview of the system and how it interacts with users.
2. **Container Diagram** – Breakdown of the system into major components.
3. **Component Diagram** – Internal structure of the main components.
4. **Code Diagram** – Detailed view of code-level architecture.

*(Diagrams will be added as the project develops.)*
