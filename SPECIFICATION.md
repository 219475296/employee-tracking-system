# Employee Tracking System

## Domain
The domain of this project is Employee Management within an organization. This system will help HR and management teams track employee activity, attendance, performance, and tasks.

## Problem Statement
Managing employee performance and tracking attendance manually is inefficient and prone to errors. The Employee Tracking System will automate these processes, allowing management to monitor employee activity in real-time, assign tasks, and generate performance reports.

## Individual Scope
The system will focus on tracking the following key components:
- Employee details (name, role, department, etc.)
- Attendance and working hours
- Task assignments and completion status
- Performance reports
- Dashboard to visualize key metrics

The project is feasible because it will use common technologies like JavaScript, React.js, and a database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL), which are well-documented and supported.
