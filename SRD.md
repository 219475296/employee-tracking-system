## Introduction

The **Employee Tracking System** is a software solution designed to streamline the process of managing employee attendance, task assignments, and performance tracking within an organization. The system will automate the tracking of clock-in and clock-out times, allow managers to assign and monitor tasks, and provide employees with real-time access to their performance data. The system aims to reduce manual errors, improve efficiency, and enhance decision-making through data-driven insights. Key users of the system include HR managers, employees, managers/supervisors, and IT staff. This document outlines the detailed requirements for the system, which will ensure it meets the needs of all stakeholders while maintaining high standards of security, scalability, and usability.
